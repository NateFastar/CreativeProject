                <h2>What is Troy?</h2>
                <p>Troy is a collaboration hub for projects large and small to get the help they need to succeed. Anyone can offer their services on projects and recieve Collaboration Credit in return, which they can use in turn to get help on their own projects.</p>
                <h2>What kind of projects are there?</h2>
                <p>Projects on Troy fall into one of four categories, which include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Community Projects, or projects backed by Troy for the betterment of the community. These projects are the source of Collaboration Credits.</li>
                    <li>Personal Projects, or projects backed by a member of the community. The backer offers their own Collaboration Credits in return for help.</li>
                    <li>Service Projects, or projects backed by a verified service organization. These projects offer Collaboration Credits in exchange of real world service.</li>
                    <li>Funded Projects, or projects with monetary compensation. These projects are either backed by a company or a member of the community and offer money instead of Collaboration Credits in exchange for help.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What are Collaboration Credits?</h2>
                <p>Collaboration Credits are the backbone of the community, ensuring that those who help others can be proportionately helped in return. As one contributes to a project offering Collaboration Credits they recieve credit to their account. This credit can then be used to back their own projects or exchanged to community members offering their services.</p>
                <h2>What is Troy's purpose?</h2>
                <p>The purpose of Troy is to connect those with ideas to those with skills and to foster a mutually beneficial relationship between the two so that all can prosper.</p>
                <p>Troy, it's better together!</p>
